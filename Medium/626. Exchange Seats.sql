-- 626. Exchange Seats
-- https://leetcode.com/problems/exchange-seats/description/
-- Table: Seat

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | student     | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
-- id is a continuous increment.
 

-- Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

-- Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Seat table:
-- +----+---------+
-- | id | student |
-- +----+---------+
-- | 1  | Abbot   |
-- | 2  | Doris   |
-- | 3  | Emerson |
-- | 4  | Green   |
-- | 5  | Jeames  |
-- +----+---------+
-- Output: 
-- +----+---------+
-- | id | student |
-- +----+---------+
-- | 1  | Doris   |
-- | 2  | Abbot   |
-- | 3  | Green   |
-- | 4  | Emerson |
-- | 5  | Jeames  |
-- +----+---------+
-- Explanation: 
-- Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

-- Solution : 

select (case 
when mod(id,2) = 1 and id = (select max(id) from seat) then id
when mod(id,2) = 1 then id+1
when mod(id,2) = 0 then id-1
end)
as id,student from seat
order by id;
